# `darkvi` Player library
 `darkvi` - a modern player of a new generation. The main idea is to create a fully modular player ranging from UI components to logic.

Thanks to web components, a minimalistic size and independence of the UI from popular frameworks or work logic are achieved. You can install the player core and use your own controls by writing them in the js framework you need, or use the npm package with the components provided by this library.
